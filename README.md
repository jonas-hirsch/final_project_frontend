My Team and I created an E-commerce Store without any UI Library or pre-build backend. We created everything from Scratch in 3 Weeks.

Components which you see here in this Project, can be downloaded be used with NPM ( minja-ui ).

This Store has an Auth for getting acces to the Cart and Shipping process....

Have fun and use whatever you want from this Project.
